# The Prime Scale

This program was created in a day to answer the question, "Can there be a faster day to check for prime?"

It evolved from ***being able to find a certain "nth" prime***, to ***finding the number of primes under a number***, to being able to ***check whether a number is prime or not***. 


The code contains comments on what it does at each stage. If there are still questions regarding how I came to certain conclusions or got the equation, leave a comment.
